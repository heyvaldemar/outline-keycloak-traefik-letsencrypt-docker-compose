# Outline with Keycloak and Let's Encrypt Using Docker Compose

# The complete installation guide is available on my website https://www.heyvaldemar.com/install-outline-and-keycloak-using-docker-compose/

# Change variables in the `.env` to meet your requirements.
# Note that the `.env` file should be in the same directory as `01-traefik-outline-letsencrypt-docker-compose.yml`, `02-keycloak-outline-docker-compose.yml`, and `03-outline-minio-redis-docker-compose.yml`.

# The value for the `OUTLINE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` variable can be obtained after installing Keycloak using `02-keycloak-outline-docker-compose.yml`.

# Additionally, you need to specify your values for `OUTLINE_SECRET_KEY` and `OUTLINE_UTILS_SECRET`.
# The values for `OUTLINE_SECRET_KEY` and `OUTLINE_UTILS_SECRET` can be generated using the command:
# `openssl rand -hex 32`

# Create networks for your services before deploying the configuration using the commands:
# `docker network create traefik-network`
# `docker network create keycloak-network`
# `docker network create outline-network`

# Deploy Traefik using Docker Compose:
# `docker compose -f 01-traefik-outline-letsencrypt-docker-compose.yml -p traefik up -d`

# Deploy Keycloak using Docker Compose:
# `docker compose -f 02-keycloak-outline-docker-compose.yml -p keycloak up -d`

# Create a new `Realm` on Keycloak and name it `outline` (case sensitive).

# Create a `Client` in the new realm and configure it:
# 1. Client type: `OpenID Connect`
# 2. Client ID: `outline` (case sensitive)
# 3. Client authentication: `on`
# 4. Authentication flow: uncheck all other options and leave only `Standard flow`
# 5. Set URLs:
# - In the `Root URL` field, enter `https://outline.heyvaldemar.net/`
# - In the `Home URL` field, enter `https://outline.heyvaldemar.net/`
# - In the `Valid redirect URIs` field, enter `https://outline.heyvaldemar.net/*`

# Please note, outline.heyvaldemar.net is the domain name of my service. 
# Accordingly, you need to specify your domain name,
# which points to the IP address of your server with the installed Traefik service,
# which will redirect the request to Outline.

# Get a `Client secret` value on the `Credentials` tab of the `Client` that you created.
# Specify the `OUTLINE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` variable in the `.env`.

# Create a user on Keycloak for Outline.
# Note that you have to specify an email address and a username.
# Set a password for the new user.

# Deploy Keycloak using Docker Compose:
# `docker compose -f 03-outline-minio-redis-docker-compose.yml -p outline up -d`

# Log in to Outline with the Username or Email specified on the Keycloak.

# Backups
# The `backups-keycloak` container in the configuration is responsible for the following:
# 1. **Database Backup**: Creates compressed backups of the PostgreSQL database using pg_dump.
# Customizable backup path, filename pattern, and schedule through variables like `KEYCLOAK_POSTGRES_BACKUPS_PATH`, `KEYCLOAK_POSTGRES_BACKUP_NAME`, and `KEYCLOAK_BACKUP_INTERVAL`.
# 2. **Backup Pruning**: Periodically removes backups exceeding a specified age to manage storage. Customizable pruning schedule and age threshold with `KEYCLOAK_POSTGRES_BACKUP_PRUNE_DAYS`.

# The `backups-outline` container in the configuration is responsible for the following:
# 1. **Application Data Backup**: Compresses and stores backups of the application data on the same schedule. Controlled via variables such as `OUTLINE_DATA_BACKUPS_PATH`, `OUTLINE_DATA_BACKUP_NAME`, and `OUTLINE_BACKUP_INTERVAL`.
# 2. **Backup Pruning**: Periodically removes backups exceeding a specified age to manage storage. Customizable pruning schedule and age threshold with `OUTLINE_DATA_BACKUP_PRUNE_DAYS`.
# By utilizing these containers, consistent and automated backups of the essential components of your instance are ensured.
# Moreover, efficient management of backup storage and tailored backup routines can be achieved through easy and flexible configuration using environment variables.

# # keycloak-restore-database.sh Description
# This script facilitates the restoration of a database backup:
# 1. **Identify Containers**: It first identifies the service and backups containers by name, finding the appropriate container IDs.
# 2. **List Backups**: Displays all available database backups located at the specified backup path.
# 3. **Select Backup**: Prompts the user to copy and paste the desired backup name from the list to restore the database.
# 4. **Stop Service**: Temporarily stops the service to ensure data consistency during restoration.
# 5. **Restore Database**: Executes a sequence of commands to drop the current database, create a new one, and restore it from the selected compressed backup file.
# 6. **Start Service**: Restarts the service after the restoration is completed.
# To make the `keycloak-restore-database.shh` script executable, run the following command:
# `chmod +x keycloak-restore-database.sh`
# Usage of this script ensures a controlled and guided process to restore the database from an existing backup.

# # outline-restore-database.sh Description
# This script facilitates the restoration of a database backup:
# 1. **Identify Containers**: It first identifies the service and backups containers by name, finding the appropriate container IDs.
# 2. **List Backups**: Displays all available database backups located at the specified backup path.
# 3. **Select Backup**: Prompts the user to copy and paste the desired backup name from the list to restore the database.
# 4. **Stop Service**: Temporarily stops the service to ensure data consistency during restoration.
# 5. **Restore Database**: Executes a sequence of commands to drop the current database, create a new one, and restore it from the selected compressed backup file.
# 6. **Start Service**: Restarts the service after the restoration is completed.
# To make the `outline-restore-database.shh` script executable, run the following command:
# `chmod +x outline-restore-database.sh`
# Usage of this script ensures a controlled and guided process to restore the database from an existing backup.

# # outline-restore-application-data.sh Description
# This script is designed to restore the application data:
# 1. **Identify Containers**: Similarly to the database restore script, it identifies the service and backups containers by name.
# 2. **List Application Data Backups**: Displays all available application data backups at the specified backup path.
# 3. **Select Backup**: Asks the user to copy and paste the desired backup name for application data restoration.
# 4. **Stop Service**: Stops the service to prevent any conflicts during the restore process.
# 5. **Restore Application Data**: Removes the current application data and then extracts the selected backup to the appropriate application data path.
# 6. **Start Service**: Restarts the service after the application data has been successfully restored.
# To make the `outline-restore-application-data.sh` script executable, run the following command:
# `chmod +x outline-restore-application-data.sh`
# By utilizing this script, you can efficiently restore application data from an existing backup while ensuring proper coordination with the running service.
